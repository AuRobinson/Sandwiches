# Sandwiches

## BLUF

Inspiration from this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/87h4bw/number_of_sandwiches_in_an_nslice_loaf_of_bread/)

## Formula

In the context of the thought experiment, the following equation can be used to determine the number of "sandwiches" that are _contained_ in a loaf of bread. Where a sandwich is defined as "Two or more slices of bread with a filling... between them."

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{2} (x^2 - 3x + 2)$$
